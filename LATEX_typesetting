\textbf{Problem 1.} Show that there exits no nontrivial unramified extentions of  $Q$\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:} If $K/Q$ is a nontrivial number field, then $|$ disc$K$$|$$>$ 1. But then disc $K$ has a prime factor so that some Prime ramifies in $K$.\\
\\
\textbf{Problem 2.} Complete the following:\\
\\
(a) How does one prove a cotheorem?\\
\\
(b) Compute $\int cos x dx.$\\
\\
\text{(c) How does one square}
$\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d 

\end{pmatrix}?$\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:}\\
\\
\text{(a) Use rollaries.}\\
\\
(b) We have\\

\begin{equation}
\int cos x dx= sinx+C  
\end{equation}\\
We can check (1):\\
\begin{center}
   \[\frac{d}{d x}(sin x+C)=cos x\]
\end{center}
\textbf{Problem 3.} Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
\\ \\\textit{proof.} Assume that  $\sqrt{2}$ = $\frac{a}{b}$, where \textit{a,b} $\in$ $Z$. Without loss of generality, we may assume gcd \textit{(a,b)} = \\ \\ 1.Then we have
\begin{center}
 $\sqrt{2}$ = $\frac{a}{b}$    
 \begin{equation}
      \sqrt{2}^2 = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{a}{b} \end{pmatrix}^2
 \end{equation}
 2=$\frac{a^2}{b^2}$
 \begin{equation}
     a^2=2b^2
 \end{equation}
 \text{But then from(3), we know that $a^2$ is even so that a is even. But then we must have}
\\ $2a^2=b^2$
\\ \text{So that $b^2$ is even, implying b is even. But then gcd $(a,b)\ge 2$, a contradiction.} \\

4.\textbf{Solving puzzle:} 1.In class, we did three puzzles, the first of which is equivalent to finite automata. In general, a puzzle of this type has a frame like this (but possibly with more/fewer squares and different colors):\\

And a finite set of this (but possibly with more/fewer tiles and different colors):

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{puz-2}

The tiles must be arranged so that adjacent areas have matching colors. There is an unlimited number of copies of each tile.\\\\
(a) Show how every puzzle of this type can be converted into finite automation \textit{M} and a string \textit{w} such that \textit{M} accepts \textit{w} if and only if the puzzle has no solution.\\\\
(b) Apply your construction to the above instance.\\\\
(c) Briefly describe how this gives an \textit{O}(n) algorithm for solving puzzles of this type.
